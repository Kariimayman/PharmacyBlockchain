
This is my First project using NEAR and BLOCKCHAINS,This project was created as a submission for an internship program.
My idea is that pharmacies logs are non-changeable and this program simulates a demo of pharmacy that keeps all of its logs on the chain to protect doctors/consumers from fraud and drugs misuse.
The AddDrug function simulates the supplier adding new drugs to the pharmacy
The RemoveDrung function simulates the consumer purchasing a drug from the pharmacy
Use this account for an already tested and deployed program -> project.kareemayman.testnet
Try using the View functions on the PowerShell terminal and any other functions on Bash terminal because sometimes it would return a random error and this is what worked for me
